Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this simple and beginner-friendly database guide.  
I created this as part of a college project, but I hope it helps anyone who's just getting started with databases.

ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s inside:
- Easy explanations

Whether you're a student, self-learner, or just curious, feel free to explore and use anything here.

Hope this helps you as much as it helped me!
